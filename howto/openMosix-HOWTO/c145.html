>A very, very brief introduction to clustering</A
></H1
><P
>&#13; Most of the time, your computer is bored. Start a program like xload
  or top that monitors your system use, and you will probably find that
  your processor load is not even hitting the 1.0 mark. If you have two
  or more computers, chances are that at any given time, at least one
  of them is doing nothing. Unfortunately, when you really do need CPU
 power - during a C++ compile, or encoding Ogg Vorbis music files -
 you need a lot of it at once. The idea behind clustering is to spread
  these loads among all available computers, using the resources that
  are free on other machines.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13; The basic unit of a cluster is a single computer, also called a
  "node". Clusters can grow in size - they "scale" - by adding more
  machines. A cluster as a whole will be more powerful the faster the
  individual computers and the faster their connection speeds are. In
  addition, the operating system of the cluster must make the best use
  of the available hardware in response to changing conditions. This
  becomes more of a challenge if the cluster is composed of different
  hardware types (a "heterogeneous" cluster), if the configuration of
  the cluster changes unpredictably (machines joining and leaving the
  cluster), and the loads cannot be predicted ahead of time.  &#13;</P

>HPC vs Fail-over vs Load-balancing</A
></H3
><P
>Basically there are 3 types of clusters, 
Fail-over, Load-balancing and HIGH Performance Computing, 
The most deployed ones are probably the Failover cluster and the Load-balancing Cluster.&#13;</P
><P

><UL

><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Fail-over Clusters</I
> consist of 2 or more network connected
computers with a separate heartbeat connection between the 2 hosts.
The Heartbeat connection between the 2 machines is being used to
monitor whether all the services are still in use: as soon as a
service on one machine breaks down the other machines try to take
over.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>With load-balancing clusters the concept is that when a request for
say a web-server comes in, the cluster checks which machine is the
least busy and then sends the request to that machine.  Actually most
of the times a Load-balancing cluster is also a Fail-over cluster but
with the extra load balancing functionality and often with more nodes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The last variation of clustering is the High Performance Computing
Cluster: the machines are being configured specially to give data
centers that require extreme performance what they need.  Beowulfs
have been developed especially to give research facilities the
computing speed they need. These kind of clusters also have some
load-balancing features; they try to spread different processes to
more machines in order to gain performance. But what it mainly comes
down to in this situation is that a process is being parallelized and
that routines that can be ran separately will be spread on different
machines instead of having to wait till they get done one after
another.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Most common known examples of loadbalancing and failover clusters are webfarms, databases or firewalls.
People want to have a 99,99999% uptime for their services, the internet is open 24/24 7/7/ 365/365 
not unlike in the old days when you could shut down your server when the office closed. </P
><P
>People that are in need of cpu cycles often can afford to schedule downtime for their environments, 
as long as they can use the maximum power of their machines when they need it.</P

>Supercomputers vs. clusters</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;Traditionally Supercomputers have only been built by a 
selected number of vendors: a company or organization that required
the performance of such a machine had to have a huge budget available
for its Supercomputer.  Lots of universities could not afford the
costs of a Supercomputer by themselves, therefore other alternatives
were being researched by them.  The concept of a cluster was born when
people first tried to spread different jobs over more computers and
then gather back the data those jobs produced.  With cheaper and more
common hardware available to everybody, results similar to real
Supercomputers were only to be dreamed of during the first years, but
as the PC platform developed further, the performance gap between a
Supercomputer and a cluster of multiple personal computers became
smaller.&#13;</P

>Cluster models [(N)UMA,  PVM/MPI]</A
></H3
><P
>There are different ways of doing parallel processing: (N)UMA, DSM,
PVM and MPI are all different kinds of Parallel Processing schemes. Some of them are implemented in hardware, 
others in software, others in both.</P
><P
>(N)UMA ((Non-)Uniform Memory Access), machines for example have
shared access to the memory where they can execute their code.  In the
Linux kernel there is a NUMA implementation that varies the memory
access times for different regions of memory.  It then is the kernel's
task to use the memory that is the closest to the CPU it is using.</P
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DSM</I
> aka Distributed Shared memory, has been implemented in both software and hardware , 
the concept is to provide an abstraction layer for physically distributed memory.</P
><P
>PVM and  MPI are the tools that are most commonly being used when people
talk about GNU/Linux based Beowulfs. </P
><P
> MPI stands for Message Passing
Interface. It is the open standard specification for message passing
libraries.  MPICH is one of the most used implementations of MPI. Next
to MPICH you also can find LAM, another implementation of MPI based on
the free reference implementation of the libraries.&#13;</P
><P
>PVM or Parallel Virtual Machine is another cousin of MPI that is also
quite often being used as a tool to create a Beowulf.  PVM lives in
user space so no special kernel modifications are required: basically
each user with enough rights can run PVM.

>openMosix's role</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;  The openMosix software package turns networked computers running
  GNU/Linux into a cluster. It automatically balances the load between
  different nodes of the cluster, and nodes can join or leave the
  running cluster without disruption of the service. The load is
  spread out among nodes according to their connection and CPU speeds.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  Since openMosix is part of the kernel and maintains full
  compatibility with Linux, a user's programs, files, and other
  resources will all work as before without any further changes. The
  casual user will not notice the difference between a Linux and an
  openMosix system. To her, the whole cluster will function as one
  (fast) GNU/Linux system.&#13;</P
><P
>openMosix is a Linux-kernel patch which provides full compatibility
with standard Linux for IA32-compatible platforms. The internal
load-balancing algorithm transparently migrates processes to other
cluster members.  The advantage is a better load-sharing between the
nodes. The cluster itself tries to optimize utilization at any time
(of course the sysadmin can affect the automatic load-balancing by
manual configuration during runtime).</P
><P
>This transparent process-migration feature makes the whole cluster
look like a BIG SMP-system with as many processors as available
cluster-nodes (of course multiplied with X for X-processor systems
such as dual/quad systems and so on).  openMosix also provides a
powerful optimized File System (oMFS) for HPC-applications, which
unlike NFS provides cache, time stamp and link consistency.</P
