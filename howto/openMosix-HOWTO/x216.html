>&#13; openMosix clusters can take various forms. To demonstrate this, let's
 assume you are a student and share a dorm room with a rich computer
 science guy, with whom you have linked computers to form an openMosix
 cluster.  Let's also assume you are currently converting music files
 from your CDs to Ogg Vorbis for your private use, which is legal in
 your country. Your roommate is working on a project in C++ that he
 says will bring World Peace. However, at just this moment he is in
 the bathroom doing unspeakable things, and his computer is idle.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  So when you start a program like bladeenc  to convert Bach's 
  .... from .wav to .ogg format, the openMosix routines on your
  machine compare the load on both nodes and decide that things will
  go faster if that process is sent from your Pentium-233 to his
  Athlon XP. This happens automatically: you just type or click your
  commands as you would if you were on a standalone machine. All you
  notice is that when you start two more coding runs, things go a lot
  faster, and the response time doesn't go down.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  Now while you're still typing ...., your roommate comes back,
  mumbling something about red chili peppers in cafeteria food. He
  resumes his tests, using a program called 'pmake', a version of
  'make' optimized for parallel execution. Whatever he's doing, it
  uses up so much CPU time that openMosix even starts to send
  subprocesses to your machine to balance the load.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  This setup is called *single-pool*: all computers are used as a
  single cluster. The advantage/disadvantage of this is that your
  computer is part of the pool: your stuff will run on other
  computers, but their stuff will run on yours too.&#13;</P
