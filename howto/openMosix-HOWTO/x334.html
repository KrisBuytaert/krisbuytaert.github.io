> First of all, you must understand that openMosix is made up of
a kernel patch and some user-space tools. The kernel patch is needed
to make the kernel capable of talking to other openMosix-enabled
machines on the network. If you download openMosix as a binary package
(such as an rpm file), you don't even need to take care about the
kernel patch because the kernel has been patched and compiled with the
most common default options and modules for you.  </P
><P
> The user-space tools are needed in order to make an effective
use of an openMosix-enabled kernel. They are needed to start/stop the
migration daemon, the openMosix File System, to migrate jobs to
certain nodes and other tasks which are usually
accomplished with the help our good old friend: the command line
interface. About binary packages: the same as in the kernel patch goes
for the user-space tools: if you install an rpm you don't need to
care about compiling them or configuring anything; just let them install
and run. That's all. Really :) </P
><P
> Once you get to the download page (which we'll talk about in a
second), you'll need to get two distinct parts: the kernel and the
user-space tools. You can either download two binary packages or get
the kernel patch plus the user-space tools' sources. The kernel patch
is usually named after this scheme: openMosix-x.y.z-w where x.y.z is
the version of the vanilla Linux Kernel against which the patch should
be applied and w is the patch revision for that particular kernel
release. For the precompiled kernel binaries, please refer to the
README-openMosix-kernel.txt file you'll find in the download
page. This file also contains updated info about manually compiling a
kernel. </P
><P
> About the user-space tools: you'll find those in a package
named openmosix-tools. We use the terms user-space tools,
userspace-tools and openmosix-tools interchangeably.
Updated info about precompiled binaries and
manually compiling the tools are also provided in the
README-openmosix-tools.txt file. Please note that since version 0.3 of
the openmosix-tools, the openmosix.map file is deprecated and the use
of the autodiscovery daemon is highly encouraged since it tends to
make your life easier. </P
