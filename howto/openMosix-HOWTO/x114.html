>&#13;  This document gives a brief description of openMosix, a software package
  that turns a network of GNU/Linux computers into a computer cluster.
  Along the way, some background to parallel processing is given, as
  well as a brief introduction to programs that make special use of
  openMosix's capabilities. The HOWTO expands on the documentation as it
  provides more background information and discusses the quirks of
  various distributions.</P
><P
>  Since the creation of this HOWTO some people of the Mosix team created 
openMosix (more info later), initially 
both openMosix and Mosix were  discussed 
in this HOWTO. 

Although lots of information might be valuable to both users of Mosix and 
openMosix. I decided to  split the HOWTO. The latest relase of the 
Mosix HOWTO, containing info about both Mosix and OpenMosix will be 0.20 
and can be found on

>  Kris Buytaert got involved in this piece of work when Scot Stevenson was 
  looking for somebody to take over the Job: this was during February 2002.
  While initially we discussed both Mosix and openMosix, this version 
  of the HOWTO now mainly focuses on openMosix.  Please note that 
  the document often still mentions Mosix where it should read openMosix.</P
><P
>&#13;
You will notice that some of the headings are not as serious as they
should be. Scot had planned to write the HOWTO in a slightly lighter
style, as the world (and even the part of the world with a burping
penguin as a mascot) is full of technical literature that is deadly.
Therefore some parts still have these comments.&#13;</P
