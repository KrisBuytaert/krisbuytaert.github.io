>As of 2.4.26-om1 oMFS has been removed from openMosix</P

>People often get confused about what exactly MFS and DFSA 
are.  
As discussed before in the howto MFS is the feature of openMosix 
that enables you access to remote filesystems as if those 
filesystems were locally mounted.  They are mostly mounted on 
/mfs . A common misunderstanding is that you need MFS in order 
to have openMosix working, this is not true, however it can make 
things easier.

>With DFSA enabled, system calls  will be executed on the remote 
node withouth migrating the process back to it's home node. This 
behaviour (direct filesystem access) causes processes migratiing 
to the data and not the other way around (which is common).  If 
DFSA is not enabled MfS is "just" a non-caching 
network-filesystem.</P
><P
>&#13;
Very generally speaking, if you don't have DFSA turned on, each and 
every I/O will go to the home node for execution. With DFSA turned on, 
if the file happens to be residing on the node where the process finds 
itself then the I/O will happen locally.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;A very common error is that people mix kernels with DFSA enabled 
and disabled.  So one has to have a way to find out wether DFSA 
is actually enabled. This information can be obtained by typing
