>At first QT &#62;= 2.3.x is required. 
The QTDIR -environment variable has to be set to your QT-installation 
directories like it is well described in the INSTALL- file. 
In versions &#60; 0.6 you can do a "make clean" and delete the two files: 
/openmosixview/Makefile 
/openmosixview/config.cache 
and try to compile again because i alway left the binary- 
and object-files in older versions. 
If you have any other problems post them to the 
openMosixview-mailinglist (or directly to me). &#13;</P

>Yes, until version 0.7 there is a built-in SSH-support. 
You have to be able to ssh to each node in your cluster without password 
(just like the same with using RSH this is required) </P

Do not fork openMosixview in the background with &#38; (e.g. openMosixview &#38;). 
Maybe you cannot rsh/ssh (depends on what you want to use) as user root 
without password to each node? 
Try "rsh hostname" as root. You should not been promped for a password 
but soon get a login shell. 
(If you use SSH try "ssh hostname" as root.) 
You have to be root on the cluster because that is the only way the 
administrative commands executed by openMosixview requires root-privileges. 
openMosixview uses "rsh" as the default! 
If you only have "ssh" installed on your cluster 
edit (or create) the file /root/.openMosixview and put "1111" in it. 
This is the main-configuration 
file for openMosixview and the last "1" stands for "use ssh instead of rsh". 
This will cause openMosixview to use "ssh" even for the first start. &#13;</P

The openMosixview-client is executed per rsh 
(or ssh which you can configer whith a checkbox) 
on the remote host. It has to be installed in /usr/bin/ on each node. 
If you use RSH try: 
"xhost +hostname" 
"rsh hostname /usr/bin/openMosixview_client -display your_local_host_name:0.0" 
or if you use SSH try: 
"xhost +hostname" 
"ssh hostname /usr/bin/openMosixview_client -display your_local_host_name:0.0" 
If this works it will work in openMosixview too. 
openMosixview crashes with "segmentation fault"! 
Maybe you still use an old version of openMosixview/Mosixview ? 
in the mosix.map-parser (which is completly removed in openMosixview !!) 
(the versions openMosixview 1.2 and Mosixview &#62; 1.0 are stable) </P

(automigration on/off, blocking on/off......) 
I want them to be preselected too. 

The problem is to get the information of node. 
You have to login to each cluster-node because these information 
are not cluster-wide (to my mind). 
The status of each node is stored in the /proc/hpc/admin directory 
of each node. Everybody who knows a good way to get these information 
easy is invited to mail me.
