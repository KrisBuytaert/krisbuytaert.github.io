>Announcing MO6 for BSD/OS 3.0
Oren Laadan (orenl@cs.huji.ac.il)
Tue, 9 Sep 1997 19:50:12 +0300 (IDT)

Hi:

We are pleased to announce the availability of MO6 Version 3.0
Release 1.04 (beta-4) - compatible with BSD/OS 3.0, patch level
K300-001 through M300-029.

MO6 is a 6 processor version of the MOSIX multicomputer enhancements
of BSD/OS for a PC Cluster. If you have 2 to 6 PC's connected by a
LAN, you can experience truly multi-computing environment by using
the MO6 enhancements.

The MO6 Distribution
--------------------
MO6 is available either in "source" or "binary" distribution. It is
installed as a patch to BSD/OS, using an interactive installation
script.

MO6 is available at http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/mirrors/mosix/
or at our site: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/mosix/

Main highlights of the current release:
--------------------------------------
- Memory ushering (depletion prevention) by process migration.
- Improved installation procedure.
- Enhanced migration control.
- Improved administration tools.
- More user utilities.
- More documentation and new man pages.
- Dynamic configurations.

Please send feedback and comments to mosix@cs.huji.ac.il.

GNU/Linux was chosen as a development platform for the 7th
incarnation in 1999.

Early  1999 Mosix M06 Beta was released for Linux 2.2.1 

At the end of 2001 and early 2002 openMosix, the open version of Mosix was 
born (more in the next paragraph).  </P

><P
>openMosix is in addition to whatever you find at mosix.org and in full 
appreciation and respect for Prof. Barak's leadership in the
outstanding Mosix project.</P
><P
>Moshe Bar has been involved for a number of years with the Mosix
project (www.mosix.com) and was co-project manager of the Mosix
project and general manager of the commercial Mosix company.</P
><P
>After a difference of opinions on the commercial future of Mosix, he
has started a new clustering company - Qlusters, Inc. - and
Prof. Barak has decided not to participate for the moment in this
venture (although he did seriously consider joining) and held long
running negotiations with investors.

It appears that Mosix is not any longer supported openly as a GPL
project.  Because there is a significant user base out there (about
1000 installations world-wide), Moshe Bar has decided to continue the
development and support of the Mosix project under a new name:
openMosix and under the full GPL2 license. Whatever code in openMosix
comes from the old Mosix project is Copyright 2002 by Amnon Barak. All
the new code is Copyright 2002 by Moshe Bar.</P
><P
>There could (and will) be significant changes in the architecture of
the future openMosix versions.  New concepts about auto-configuration,
node-discovery and new user-land tools are being discussed in the
openMosix mailing lists. Most of these new functionalities are already
implemented while some of them, such as DSM (Distributed Shared
Memory) are still being worked on at the moment I write this (march
2003).</P
><P
>To approach standardization and future compatibility the
proc-interface has changed from /proc/mosix to /proc/hpc and the
/etc/mosix.map was changed to /etc/hpc.map. More recently the standard
for the config file has been set to be located in /etc/openmosix.map
(this is in fact the first config file the /etc/init.d/openmosix
script will look for).  Adapted command-line user-space tools for
openMosix are already available on the web-page of the project.</P
><P
>The openmosix.map config file can be replaced with a
node-auto-discovery system which is called omdiscd (openMosix auto
DISCovery Daemon) about which we will discuss later.</P
><P
>openMosix is supported by various competent people (see
openmosix.sourceforge.net) working together around the world.  The
main goal of the project is to create a standardized
clustering-environment for all kinds of HPC-applications.</P
><P
>openMosix has also a project web-page at <A

with a CVS tree and mailing-lists for developers as well as users.</P

>  Like most active Open Source programs, openMosix's rate of change
  tends to outstrip the followers' ability to keep the documentation
  up to date.</P
><P
>  As I write this part in February 2003 openMosix 2.4.20 is available
  and openMosix Userland Tools v0.2.4 are available, including the new
autodiscovery tools.</P
