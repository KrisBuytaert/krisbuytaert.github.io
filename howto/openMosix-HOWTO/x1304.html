>&#13;First of all , are you using the same kernel version on each machine ? 
The 'same-kernel' refers to the version. You can build different kernel 
images of the same source version to meet the hardware/software needs of a 
given node.
However you wil need toe make sure that when you install openMosix 
on your cluster, all your machines should have the openmosix-x.x.x-y 
kernel installed, in contrast to having one machine running 
openmosix-x.x.z-x, another running openmosix-x.x.x-y, another running 
openmosix x.x.x-z, and so on and so forth
&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;When you run mosmon, press t to see the total of machines running. Does 
it warn you that mosix is not running?</P
><P
>&#13;If yes, then make sure your machine's ip is included in /etc/mosix.map 
(don't use 127.0.0.1 - if your machine's ip is such, then you probably 
have problems with your dhcp server/nameserver). If it does not tell you 
that mosix is not running, see what machines show up. Do you see only your 
machine?</P
><P
>&#13;If yes, then your machine is most likely running a firewall and is not 
letting openmosix through.</P
><P
>&#13;If not, then the problem is most likely with the machine that doesn't show 
up.

Also: Do you have two nic cards on a node? then you have to edit the 
/etc/hosts file to have a line that has the following format 
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>non-cluster_ip  cluster-hostname.cluster-domain cluster-hostname</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Or you can supply a -p option to the setpe script to point to the openmosix id of the node it shoud recognise as "self". For example if your internal cluster IP of the master node is "cnode1", you might have an openmosix.map file like

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>1 cnode1 	1
2 cnode2     	1 </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

in which case the setpe script needs to be invoked with "setpe -p1 ...".
In the same case the /etc/hosts file might read
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>127.0.0.1 localhost
123.456.7.89 usual.name.domain nickname
192.168.0.1 cnode1
192.168.0.2 cnode2</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

 Then
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>setpe -p1 -f /etc/openmosix.map </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
will give you what you want. You may wish to edit the openmosix init
script to do this properly.</P
><P
>You might also need to set up a routing table, which is a whole different subject. </P
><P
>Maybe you used different kernel-parameters on each machine? Especially if 
you use the 'Support clusters with a complex network topology' option you 
should take care that you use the same value for the also appearing option 
'Maximum network-topology complexity support' on each machine.
