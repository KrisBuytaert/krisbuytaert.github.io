> When it comes to configuring openMosix Clusters with a pool of
servers and a set of (personal) workstations, you have different
options that will have their advantages and disadvantages.


<P

><UL
><LI
><P
>In a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Single-pool</I
> configuration all the servers
and workstations are used as a single cluster: each machine is a part
of the cluster and can migrate processes to each other existing node.
This of course makes your workstation a part of the pool.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In an environment that is called a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Server-pool</I
>,
servers are a part of the cluster while workstations aren't part of
it, they don't even have openMosix kernel.  If you want to run 
applications on the cluster you will need to
specifically log on to these servers.  However your workstation will also 
stay
clean and no remote processes will migrate to it.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A third alternative is called an <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Adaptive-pool</I
>
configuration: here servers are shared while workstations join or
leave the cluster. Imagine your workstation being used during daytime
by yourself but, as soon as you log out in the evening, a script tells
the workstation to join the cluster and start crunching numbers. This
way your machine is being used while you don't need it. If you need
the resources of the machine again just run the openmosix stop script
and your processes will stay away from the cluster and vice-versa.</P
><P
>Practically this means that you will change the role of your machine 
by using mosctl.</P
