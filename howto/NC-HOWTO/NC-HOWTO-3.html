<H3>Netstation Clients</H3>


<P>An NC, connected to your local Network, most likely by a UTP connection , thus
via a cross-cable or HUB connecting to an Server - in this case a Linux Box 
Basically the NC is Made to work with either AS/400 , Windows
NT or AIX Servers. These are all expensive solutions,  however working
with thin clients doesnt have to cost that much.  (Token Ring versions are 
also available) </P>
<P>The model I have at my disposal is an IBM Network Station model 8361-100,
On the inside you can find an 403PPC chip, some S3 vga components, an
PCMCIA slot, and normal 72 pin (parity ??) simms.
I found 8+32 Mb in my edition.</P>
<P>Actually those 40Mb were major overkill.  In
full operation modes  with lot's of configuration 
panels a couple of telnet sessions and a X -query open only took up   
about 4Mb of ram.  )   So taking out the 32Mb showed absolutely no
significant loss of speed.  </P>

<P>Well, after working more with the Netstation, specially with Navio I found
out Navio uses  as much 27-30 Mb.  So those 40 Mb`s really aren`t that
much hoverkill</P>


<P>We proved it was no problem setting it up on a  
Linux only network.  You'll need a server that can provide you both with
about 25Mb of free diskspace for the software, and the capacities to run
an X -query.   In the setup overhere we used a 486DX50 with 8Mb as a
fileserver and I switch between another  486DX266 (PS/2 85) with 32Mb,  
and my Multia with 48Mb as the X server
Of course, the faster machines the better.</P>

<H3>Changes in the new versions.</H3>


<P>The new version comes with a new kernel and some changes in the
applications.
The kernel  can now be downloaded as a compressed file which speeds up the
process.</P>
<P>Starting with the Network Station 3.0, you need a new Boot Monitor or boot
PROM
(aka Firmware) with the version 3.0.x or later. Your NetworkStation won't
work
with a older boot PROM (aka Firmware) and the new Network Station 3.x
kernel.
If you buy a new NetworkStation, you always get one of the latest PROMs Older
versions can be automatically updated from a boot server, from which the
new boot PROM get's downloaded. (Could somebody please confirm me that these devices are the 110 versions
with a PPC 403GC(X) in it !!!!)</P>

<P>There also is a new layout of the Setup Utility where you define you basic
network settings of your Network Station.</P>


<H3>Netvista Clients</H3>

<P>The Netvista Clients (2200 and 2800) have been designed to run Linux 
natively, those thin clients are not based on PowerPC Chips but on an 
Intel Chipset therefore running linux on those devices is quite 
straightforward</P>

</H2>


<H3>IBM Software.</H3>


<H3>Netstation Software</H3>

<P>NC kernel, fonts etc.</P>
<P>In order to boot the NC you will need its Kernel and fonts.
About 25Mb of files are needed on the server.
They can be found on an AIX 4.X with the Netstation modules installed.
Or from the 
<A HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/nc/rs6000/index.html">IBM Netstation Download Page</A></P>



<H3>Netvista Software</H3>



<H3>NFS Server.</H3>

<P>A working NFS server, like in every default Linux distribution.   
Approx 85Mb of diskspace has to be exported to the NC. (this includes a
lot of documentation which you don't acutally need) </P>


<H3>X Server.</H3>

<P>Any machine running XDM with enough memory, processor power will do.
You don't need to have X configured on the machine itselve, it can
be a head-less server. Basic X Windows install will provide
you with the necessary deamons.</P>

<P> 
There is the possibility to run a local X11 server which may avoid some
network traffic.  The new version supports a standard X11  and a Motif
X11 server.  Using  a configurable menu or by allowing telnet sessions
you may access other computers/servers on the network.</P>
<P>You may also be able to export applications to your Netstation
display withouth actually using XDM . You might want to run an extra window manager.
This can be done by telnetting into the remote box and typing export DISPLAY=nc_ipnr:0
and afterwards running the application you want to use.</P>


<P>Optional</P>

<H3>DHCP Server</H3>

<P>If you have multiple NC's, you may wish to distribute the IP Adresses 
by using a DHCP Server
how to obtain and configure a DHCP server can be read in the
