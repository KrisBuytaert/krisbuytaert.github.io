<P>You found all the software you needed.  Now let's install them.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="NC-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">IBM Netstations using the AIX binaries.</A>
</H2>

<P>Before making the tarball on the aix machine, make sure you run
/usr/netstation/bin/agree in order to make the kernel in a usable format.
Probably you will have to do the same thing with the tarball you get from
the IBM website.  So finding the kernel separatly might be another
solution.
Find a drive with about 25Mb of free diskspace, I use /usr/netstation/,
and unpack the tarbal either from the IBM website or from an AIX machine.
There is no need in using the approx 60Mb from /usr/netstation/doc on
the disk if you don't have enough diskspace.</P>

</H2>

<P>This section has been contributed by Ken Collins and still have to be
crosschecked by me.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Download nsmsetup.exe from

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/network_station/nsmsetup.exe">ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/network_station/nsmsetup.exe</A> </LI>
<LI> I don't have NT set up, so I moved it over into a Win98 partition
and tried executing nsmsetup.exe. It extracted properly, then choked
on the install and removed all the install files. Then I tried opening
it with WinZip, and that worked. I just extracted everything into my
Windows partition under the directory C:/netstation.
</LI>
<LI> I then copied everything from C:/netstation/prodbase to my linux
box. I set everything up in /usr/netstation, which I think was a
mistake. I ran strings on parts of the package, and it looks like
/netstation/prodbase is compiled into various programs. I'm going to
try it again with installing in /netstation/prodbase

</LI>
<LI> Booting the kernel worked fine. I'm not sure how much of the rest
of it worked, since I've never seen a working netstation. I'm getting
a lot of error messages, but an X server comes up, and I'm able to
telnet and start Mwm.  I was able to set up xdm and log into my Linux
server, until I botched something. Now I get an IBM login screen that
doesn't allow me to log in.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Some readers have helped out here.  What you need to do is create a file 
new file that will be included in your standard.nsm or modify that file.</P>
<P>e.g. </P>
<P>You can create a file called local.nsm with the following contents  
(10.1.89.33 is your Linux Box)
<PRE>
set exec-startup-commands = { {"login 10.1.89.33"} }
set xserver-access-control-enabled = false
set tcpip-name-server-protocol = dns
set tcpip-name-servers = {{ 10.1.89.33 } }
</PRE>

and you add 
<PRE>
read local.nsm
</PRE>

to standard.nsm.</P>
<P>An alternative is to change 
a single line in
/netstation/prodbase/configs/required.nsm from
{ actlogin }
to
{ login }
to get an xdm chooser or
{ login xx.xx.xx.xx }
to do a direct xdm query to your linux box.  There's a
third way but we haven't got confirmation on this.</P>
<P>{ actlogin -authserv xx.xx.xx.xx }</P>


<P>Philip Tait wrote to tell us this :
"From the directory tree extracted from nsmsetup.exe using WinZIP
classic, copy the entire tree  under "Prodbase" to /netstation.  Export
/netstation, and proceed as for the following sections.</P>
<P>Bram Piket  wrote in with even a better version.</P>
<P>After downloading the nsmsetup.exe file you should run this file. 
There will be a probe to install the NetworkStation under this win-system.
That does not succeed (in my case?).
Don't click the last error-window away. Then there is left a tempory 
NetStation-directory: "Ixp000.tmp".
Copy the subdirectories to the linux-dir "/netstation".
Rename "x11" to "X11", "en_us" to "EN_US".
Then edit the file
"/netstation/prodbase/configs/required.nsm" to reflect 
<PRE>
set exec startup-commands=(
( mcuis )
( login vvv.xxx.yyy.zzz )
)
</PRE>

where vvv.xxx.yyy.zzz is the LINUX-server address.</P>

        rpm.log         - messages generated during install of the rpm's
        rpm.err         - errors from the rpm install (most of these can 
be ignored)

<H3>Upgrade for the IBM Network station Boot Monitor.</H3>

<P>You can download the most recent bflash images from 
http://service.boulder.ibm.com/dl/nc/priv/netsta-rd_linux
Just point the device to boot from the bflash images you downloaded and 
your firmware will upgrade itselve !.</P>

<P>Your NC should now be able to mount the /usr/netsation by NFS.</P>
<P>Bascially if you don`t need X-Windows this is as far as it gets.  You can
easily telnet from your NC with nothing more installed.  However the beauty
of this thing is it`s X capability.</P>

<P>Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn't need to set up
anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to accept
connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and it showed me
all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X -indirect).  So any
machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure XDM is

</H2>

<P>This part has been contributed by
<A HREF="mailto:jjhill@comdisco.com">Josef Hill</A></P>
<P>what I'm including
is the line for using the NS1000 with no configuration done on the box.
(defaults.. everything is left blank)</P>

<P>inetd.conf:
<PRE>
tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd in.tftpd /QIBM
</PRE>
</P>
<P>then create a directory /QIBM/ProdData/NetworkStation/</P>
<P>and copy the contents of the prodbase directory in the winzip sfx nsmsetup.exe
which you can download from
http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/dl/nc/priv/netsta-rd_nsm (you may need to
create an account to access this.. it's free and requires no real information.)
note that this download is 90some MB </P>
<P>At this point, if you've done the 3 requisite steps, your netstation will boot.
<UL>
<LI> set up DHCP</LI>
<LI> enable TFTP to the QIBM directory</LI>
<LI> copy the contents of the prodbase directory to the proper path</LI>
</UL>

Note: It will probably help an awful lot if you have xdm set up (speciffically
for xdmcp sessions).</P>

<P>If you use this approach you can obviously skip the next part ! ;-)</P>


<P> Everything on the server side should be setup now. 
Lets try the NC side.</P>
