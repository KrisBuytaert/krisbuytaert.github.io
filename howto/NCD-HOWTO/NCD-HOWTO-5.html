<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Configuring the Thin Client</A></H2>

<P>Unplug the network cable from the NC. Then boot it up.
<P>It will boot and display that fine NCD ThinSTAR logo but alse the ugly
Windows CE stuff :-)).
After the NC has booted, it displays the NCD ThinSTAR setup wizard (if you already have been
using the NC, it will not show the wizard, but by pressing ALT-CTRL-F2 you can still 
reconfigure the system).  
The first selection is the most important one: Client selection.  Be sure to change
this to NCD ThinSTAR X Client.  
<P>Then you have to setup the NC's IP address.  We did pick a static IP.  You can
also specify a DNS server, but this is not needed.  To finish pick your monitors resolution.
The NC should be restarted now.  (Windows CE Remember ;-) )
<P>After a while you will see the NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager on your screen.
First you can continue configuring your system by pressing ALT+CTRL+F2.  Things to be
configured are: keyboard and mouse.  This panel also allows you to reconfigure other
parts of your NC.  Press OK to commit changes, and you will return to the 
NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager.
<P>The NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager gives 2 options: connections and configure.
So lets configure the system first.  Pick 'X terminal' from the menu and press the edit 
or add button.
<P>The NCD ThinSTAR X Connection Properties allows you to configure the name, connection 
options, host and color.  We prefer the these settings: 
* Connection Option : XDM Query
* Host: specify when connection is made
* (other settings are not important)
You could also specify a fixed X server but the broadcast option is easier. 
<P>Basicly your done now and you should be able to start a session by double-clicking
the connection you just edited or added.  You should get a list with all the X servers
you are using.
<P>
