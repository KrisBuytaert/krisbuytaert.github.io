<P>
<P>We could play around with a NCD ThinSTAR for a while.  Although MS NT Terminal and 
Citrix Meta- &amp; Winframe are the only supported OS systems ("Powered by Windows CE" is on
the cover ...), it works fine with Linux too.  This is how !
<P>The machine we had, was a NCD ThinkSTAR 200.  It is powered by a 100MHz MIPS 4300 processor
and had the default 8MB of RAM memory.  NCD has a also other products in the ThinSTAR family.
These might also work, but we haven't the opportunity to check those.  If you have any of those,
feel free to add any comments. Or send them to us to experiment.
<P>
<P>This HOWTO will present one way to setup your ThinSTAR to be used in a Linux environment.
This isn't much of a big deal, but for what it's worth I'll descripe the needed steps here.
<P>This MINI Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, its
trying to be something for you to get started from nowhere.  Contributions
to this NC are welcome.  In fact this HOWTO is fully based on the NC-HOWTO
by Kris Buytaert in which he describes how to setup the IBM Network Station.
