<P>
<P>An NC, connected to your local Network, most likely by UTP, thus
by a cross-cable or HUB connecting to an X Server. Herafter called the
Linux Box. The NC can be used as an X-terminal, and in this way can be 
used to replace an Windows Terminal server or simular application.
<P>The NCD-ThinSTAR 200 is in way related to the IBM Network Station model 8361-100.
Both machines share a lot of components such as some S3 vga components, IO , network and  
and
normal 72pins (parity ??) sims.  The motherboard is also from the same manufacturer.
<P>The NCD worked quit fine on my network at home, but we had some trouble to
get it running again on an other location.  After a while we found out
that the problem where the monitors.  The NC does not seem to support all older
monitors, even at low resolutions and refresh rates.
<P>The Linux box does not require any special tricks: any X-server with xdm, gdm or 
something similar will do.  We will use xdm.

<H3>X Server.</H3>

<P>Any machine running XDM with enough memory, processor power will do.
You don't need to have X configured on the machine itselve, it can
perfectly be a headless server. Basic X Windows install will provide
you with the necessary deamons.
