This document tries to describe how to hook up a NCD ThinSTAR
to your local network using a Linux box as
server.

<toc>
<sect> Introduction
<sect1> What`s this document
<p>

We could play around with a NCD ThinSTAR for a while.  Although MS NT Terminal and 
Citrix Meta- & Winframe are the only supported OS systems ("Powered by Windows CE" is on
the cover ...), it works fine with Linux too.  This is how !
<p>
The machine we had, was a NCD ThinkSTAR 200.  It is powered by a 100MHz MIPS 4300 processor
and had the default 8MB of RAM memory.  NCD has a also other products in the ThinSTAR family.
These might also work, but we haven't the opportunity to check those.  If you have any of those,
feel free to add any comments. Or send them to us to experiment.

<p>
This HOWTO will present one way to setup your ThinSTAR to be used in a Linux environment.
This isn't much of a big deal, but for what it's worth I'll descripe the needed steps here.
<p>
This MINI Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, its
trying to be something for you to get started from nowhere.  Contributions
to this NC are welcome.  In fact this HOWTO is fully based on the NC-HOWTO
by Kris Buytaert in which he describes how to setup the IBM Network Station.

<sect>Requirements
<sect1>Hardware

<p>

An NC, connected to your local Network, most likely by UTP, thus
by a cross-cable or HUB connecting to an X Server. Herafter called the
Linux Box. The NC can be used as an X-terminal, and in this way can be 
used to replace an Windows Terminal server or simular application.
<p>
The NCD-ThinSTAR 200 is in way related to the IBM Network Station model 8361-100.
Both machines share a lot of components such as some S3 vga components, IO , network and  
and
normal 72pins (parity ??) sims.  The motherboard is also from the same manufacturer.
<p>
The NCD worked quit fine on my network at home, but we had some trouble to
get it running again on an other location.  After a while we found out
that the problem where the monitors.  The NC does not seem to support all older
monitors, even at low resolutions and refresh rates.
<p>
The Linux box does not require any special tricks: any X-server with xdm, gdm or 
something similar will do.  We will use xdm.
<sect1>Software

<sect2>X Server.
<p>
Any machine running XDM with enough memory, processor power will do.
You don't need to have X configured on the machine itselve, it can
perfectly be a headless server. Basic X Windows install will provide
you with the necessary deamons.

<sect2>DHCP Server (optionally)
If you have multiple NCD's, you may wish to distribute the IP Adresses 
by using a DHCP Server
how to obtain and configure a DHCP server can be read in the

<sect>Setting up the Serverside
<p>
<sect1>Setting up the X server
<p>
Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn`t need to set up
anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to accept
connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and it showed me
all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X -indirect).  So any
machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure XDM is
So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure
XDM is started.  
<p> 
Everything on the server side should be setup now. 
Lets try the NC side.


<sect>Configuring the Thin Client
<p>
Unplug the network cable from the NC. Then boot it up.

It will boot and display that fine NCD ThinSTAR logo but alse the ugly
Windows CE stuff :-)).
After the NC has booted, it displays the NCD ThinSTAR setup wizard (if you already have been
using the NC, it will not show the wizard, but by pressing ALT-CTRL-F2 you can still 
reconfigure the system).  
The first selection is the most important one: Client selection.  Be sure to change
this to NCD ThinSTAR X Client.  
<p>
Then you have to setup the NC's IP address.  We did pick a static IP.  You can
also specify a DNS server, but this is not needed.  To finish pick your monitors resolution.
The NC should be restarted now.  (Windows CE Remember ;-) )
<p>
After a while you will see the NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager on your screen.
First you can continue configuring your system by pressing ALT+CTRL+F2.  Things to be
configured are: keyboard and mouse.  This panel also allows you to reconfigure other
parts of your NC.  Press OK to commit changes, and you will return to the 
NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager.
<p>
The NCD ThinSTAR Connection Manager gives 2 options: connections and configure.
So lets configure the system first.  Pick 'X terminal' from the menu and press the edit 
or add button.
<p>
The NCD ThinSTAR X Connection Properties allows you to configure the name, connection 
options, host and color.  We prefer the these settings: 
* Connection Option : XDM Query
* Host: specify when connection is made
* (other settings are not important)
You could also specify a fixed X server but the broadcast option is easier. 
<p>
Basicly your done now and you should be able to start a session by double-clicking
the connection you just edited or added.  You should get a list with all the X servers
you are using.
